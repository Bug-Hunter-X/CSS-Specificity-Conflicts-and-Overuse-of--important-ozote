# CSS Specificity Conflicts and Overuse of !important

This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue: specificity conflicts and the overuse of the `!important` flag.  Overusing `!important` makes CSS difficult to maintain and debug, as it overrides the cascading nature of CSS styles.

The `bug.css` file showcases a scenario where specificity conflicts arise, leading to unexpected styling. The solution (`bugSolution.css`) shows how to improve the code by refactoring it to avoid `!important` and improve maintainability.
